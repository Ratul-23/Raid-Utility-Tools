# Raid Utility Tools

A collection of utility tools designed to assist with different **Wizard101 raid instances**.  
Each tool provides quality-of-life features, shortcuts, and client utilities for more efficient raiding.

## Development Notes

This project took immense effort — the **UI framework** and the systems that run behind the scenes have been rewritten multiple times to ensure stability, usability, and performance.  

Countless hours went into refining the tools, experimenting with different designs, and improving the overall raid utility framework to make it as reliable and user-friendly as possible.

## Configuration (`config.ini`)

Each tool supports a simple configuration file named **`config.ini`**.  
This file allows you to toggle common settings without modifying code.

Example:

```ini
[General]
always_on_top = True
enable_clients_tab = True
use_raid_theme = True

[Keybinds]
handle_xyz_sync = F3
toggle_speedhack = F4
toggle_freecam = F5
handle_freecam_teleport = F6
toggle_auto_dialogue = F7
```

## Custom Theme Configuration

All tools support user-defined themes to customize the look and feel of the interface.  
Themes can be configured by editing the **`custom_theme`** dictionary inside the tool’s **`themes.py`** file.

Example (Default Custom Theme):

```python
# =============================
# CUSTOM THEME CONFIGURATION
# =============================
custom_theme = {
    "window_bg": "#00775D",             # Main window background
    "text_color": "#FFFFFF",            # Default text color
    "label_color": "#FFFFFF",           # Label text color
